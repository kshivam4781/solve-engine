Converting a quantity means writing the same amount in a different unit: five
kilometres as miles, a hundred centimetres as metres, a temperature in Celsius
as Fahrenheit. The amount does not change, only the unit it is expressed in.

`to`, `in` and `into` all convert.

```solve
5 km to miles // 3.11 miles
100 cm into m // 1.00 m
1 hour to minutes // 60 minutes
72F to C // 22.22 C
20C in F // 68.00 F
20°C in F // 68.00 F
20C in °F // 68.00 °F
```

The degree sign reads the same way, on either side of a conversion: `°C`,
`°F`, `°K` and the precomposed `℃`/`℉` all name the unit their letter already
does. The bare angle degree, `90°` with nothing after it, is a different unit
(a plane angle) and is unaffected.

A conversion between two different dimensions has no answer, so it is refused
rather than guessed. The message names the dimensions rather than the units, so
`1 hour in metres` reports *a duration cannot be converted to a length* and
`5 kg in m` reports *a mass cannot be converted to a length*. Combining two
different dimensions is refused the same way: `5 kg + 3 m` reports *mass and
length cannot be added*.

## Inches, where the abbreviation is also the word for converting

`in` is how the engine spells the conversion itself, so it cannot simply be a
unit as well: `12 in ft` has to keep meaning "twelve, in feet". The word is read
as inches where there is plainly nothing to convert into, which is at the end of
a line, before an operator, or before a second `in` or a `to`.

```solve
12 in in cm // 30.48 cm
2 in + 3 in // 5.00 in
12 in to cm // 30.48 cm
```

Everywhere else it is still the preposition, including when the thing being
converted into is itself inches:

```solve
3 ft in in // 36.00 in
```

The full spellings never have to be reasoned about at all, so they are the safer
thing to write in a document somebody else will read:

```solve
12 inches in cm // 30.48 cm
1 inch in mm // 25.40 mm
```
