/**
 * `90°` as ninety degrees.
 *
 * The degree sign is in the unit table but could never reach it: the lexer
 * reads a unit as one run of `[A-Za-z0-9_]`, so a non-ASCII character cannot
 * become a UNIT token however well the converter understands it. `90°` lexed
 * as a number and an identifier, and `sin(90°)` failed with "Undefined
 * variable: °".
 *
 * Retyping it here is the whole fix. It needs no lexer change, because the
 * symbol is unambiguous: `°` is degrees and nothing else, so there is no
 * context in which this could be claiming something that was already spoken
 * for.
 *
 * Note this is the angle degree, matched only when `°` stands alone: the
 * lexer's identifier scan swallows the ASCII letters that immediately follow
 * a non-ASCII character into the same token, so `°C` and `°F` never reach
 * this rule as a bare `°` in the first place, they arrive as one IDENT
 * spelled `°C`/`°F`. Retyping those (plus `°K` and the precomposed `℃`/`℉`)
 * to the UNIT the conversion tables already hold for them is
 * DegreeUnitSymbolNormalizerRule.ts, beside this rule.
