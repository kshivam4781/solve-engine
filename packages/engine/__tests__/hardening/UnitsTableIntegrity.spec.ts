/**
 * The generated unit table, swept end to end rather than sampled.
 *
 * Every test here runs over all 1456 spellings. A table is exactly the kind of
 * artefact that hand-written tests miss: a single transcribed ratio can be
 * wrong for years because nobody ever wrote the one assertion that would have
 * caught it. Two of the four sweeps below found precisely that.
 *
 * Three properties are checked, none of which depends on knowing any real-world
 * constant:
 *
 * 1. A conversion to a measure's base unit and back returns the original value.
 * 2. A spelling of the form "square X" / "cubic X" holds the square / cube of
 *    the ratio the table already records for X, because that is what those
 *    words mean. This is what caught `square decimetre`.
 * 3. A best-unit list ascends, because `convertToBestMetric` walks it forwards
 *    and stops at the first threshold the magnitude does not reach. This is
 *    what caught illuminance.
 *
 * Plus one property that spans the table and the lexer: a spelling the lexer
 * claims must survive being typed. `turns` and `°` were both in the table and
 * unlexable before, so the two vocabularies are known to drift.
 *
 * Where a sweep found a real defect, the truthful assertion is written as
 * `test.failing`. That keeps the correct expected value in the file rather than
 * a wrong one, and turns red the day someone fixes the bug, which is when the
 * `.failing` should be deleted.
